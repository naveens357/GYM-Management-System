## 📐 Architecture & Design Patterns

This system is built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural design pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns:
* **Model**: Handles data persistence, entities, and database interactions (DAO classes).
* **View**: Handles the user interface via JSP pages (`WEB-INF/views/`).
* **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests, business logic, and routing via Java Servlets.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Controller  (Servlet)           →  handles HTTP requests/responses
    ↓
Service     (Business Logic)    →  validates and processes data
    ↓
DAO         (Data Access)       →  executes SQL queries
    ↓
Database    (MySQL)             →  persists all data
```

## 🔐 Security

- Passwords are hashed using **BCrypt** — never stored in plain text.
- Role-based access is enforced via **AuthFilter** on all `/admin/*` and `/member/*` routes.
- SQL injection is prevented through **PreparedStatements** throughout all DAO classes.
